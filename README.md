# RpnCalculator
An updated and extended version of the Xamarin XAML introduction project from http://devcenter.wintellect.com/jprosise/writing-cross-platform-mobile-apps-with-visual-studio-2015-and-xamarin-forms-2

This update uses a newer verion of the Xamarin platform so the project structure is slightly different. It also uses some updates to C# and extends the command interface to use CanExecute.

This version uses FreshMVVM for the MVVM framework.
